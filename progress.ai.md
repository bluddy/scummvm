# Project Progress: Touch-Friendly GUI for ScummVM

This document summarizes the progress made on the project to improve the ScummVM GUI for touch-based devices.

## 1. Analysis and Planning

*   **Initial Analysis:** An initial analysis of the touch control modes for Android and iOS was conducted, and the results were documented in `touch_analysis.ai.md`.
*   **Expanded Analysis:** Based on user feedback, the analysis was expanded to include the default ScummVM GUI, which was found to be unsuitable for touch-based devices. The `touch_analysis.ai.md` file was updated with this new analysis and recommendations.
*   **Implementation Plan:** A detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing a new, touch-friendly theme was created and saved to `touch_gui_plan.ai.md`.
*   **Plan Refinement:** The implementation plan was further refined to include a hamburger menu and a tab-based configuration manager, based on user feedback.

## 2. Implementation

### Phase 1: Theme Scaffolding

*   **Theme Directory:** Created a new theme directory at `gui/themes/touchmodern`.
*   **Theme File:** Created a new theme file, `gui/themes/touchmodern/touchmodern.theme`, and populated it with a basic color palette and font definitions.
*   **Build System Integration:** Created a `touchmodern.zip` archive and added it to the `dists/debian/clean` file to integrate the new theme into the build process.

### Phase 3: Layout and Navigation Implementation

*   **Layout File:** Created a new layout file, `gui/themes/touchmodern/touchmodern_layout.stx`, to define larger, more touch-friendly widget sizes and spacing.
*   **ButtonWidget:** Redesigned the `ButtonWidget` in the `touchmodern.theme` file to be larger and to include a ripple effect for touch feedback.
*   **ScrollbarWidget & ScrollContainerWidget:**
    *   Redesigned the scrollbar's visual style in the theme.
    *   Modified `scrollcontainer.h` and `scrollcontainer.cpp` to implement direct content dragging for touch-based scrolling.
*   **PopUpWidget:**
    *   Redesigned the `PopUpDialog` to be a full-screen, list-based menu for better touch interaction.
    *   Modified `popup.h` and `popup.cpp` to reflect this change.
*   **Checkbox & Radiobutton:** Redesigned the `CheckboxWidget` and `RadiobuttonWidget` in the `touchmodern.theme` file with larger, more easily tappable icons.
*   **New UI Elements (Scaffolding):**
    *   Created `touchmodern_dialogs.stx` to define the basic structure for the new hamburger menu and the tab-based, full-screen options dialog.
    *   Included this new layout file into the main `touchmodern.theme`.
    *   Created skeleton C++ classes (`HamburgerMenuDialog`, `TabbedOptionsDialog`) and integrated them into the build system.

## 3. Next Steps

The next step is to implement the functionality of the new UI elements, starting with the `HamburgerMenuDialog`.
